-  Branch creation and merging
-  Remote repository management

## Flet GUI Applications

### 1. hello_flet.py
- **Status:**  Completed
- **Features:** Interactive greeting, student info display, dialog boxes
- **UI Components:** Text, TextField, Buttons, Dialog, Containers
- **Notes:** [Any challenges or observations]

### 2. personal_info_gui.py

- **Features:** Form inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons, profile generation
- **UI Components:** TextField, Dropdown, RadioGroup, Containers, Scrolling
- **Error Handling:** Input validation and user feedback
- **Notes:** [Any challenges or observations]

## Technical Skills Developed

### Git Version Control
- Understanding of repository concepts
- Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Branch management and merging
- Remote repository collaboration

### Flet GUI Development
- Flet 0.28.3 syntax and components
- Page configuration and layout management
- Event handling and user interaction
- Modern UI design principles

## Challenges and Solutions

[
- Git push failed (no sign‑in)
  - Signed in via browser using Git Credential Manager, then push succeeded.
- Flet layout looked cramped
  - Used `Column`/`Row` with spacing and padding; called `page.update()`.
- Input validation needed
  - Added simple checks and showed a `SnackBar` message.
]

## Learning Outcomes

[
- Initialize a repo, make commits, and push to GitHub.
- Build a small Flet UI with text fields, buttons, and dialogs.
- Write event handlers and validate user input.
