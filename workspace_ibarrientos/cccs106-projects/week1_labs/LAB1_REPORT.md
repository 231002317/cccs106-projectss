## Environment Setup

### Python Installation
- **Python Version:** 3.11.9  
- **Installation Issues:** At first, the `python` command was not recognized in the terminal. I solved this by checking “Add Python to PATH” during installation and restarting the Command Prompt.  
- **Virtual Environment Created:** ✅ `cccs106_env_ibarrientos`  

### VS Code Configuration
- **VS Code Version:** 1.82.0  
- **Python Extension:** ✅ Installed and configured  
- **Interpreter:** ✅ Set to `cccs106_env_ibarrientos/Scripts/python.exe`  

### Package Installation
- **Flet Version:** 0.28.3  
- **Other Packages:** None, only the required package is installed.

## Programs Created

### 1. hello_world.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed  
- **Features:** Displays student information, calculates age, shows Python and system info  
- **Notes:** I was a bit confused with formatting at first, but f-strings made it easier.  

### 2. basic_calculator.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed  
- **Features:** Performs basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /), includes error handling, min/max calculation  
- **Notes:** I added a `try-except` block to handle invalid input without crashing the program.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Problem:** The `python` command did not work in the terminal.  
   - **Solution:** Reinstalled Python and ensured *Add Python to PATH* was checked.  

2. **Problem:** Difficulty selecting the correct Python interpreter in VS Code.  
   - **Solution:** Used the *Command Palette* → “Python: Select Interpreter” and chose the one inside the virtual environment folder.  

3. **Problem:** Confusion about the required folder structure.  
   - **Solution:** Followed the instructions step by step and created separate folders for code and screenshots.
